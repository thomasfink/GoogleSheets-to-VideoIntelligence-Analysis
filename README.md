# A GCP Video intelligence API project

### From Google Sheets to Video AI

In this project I am using a simple Google Sheet as a front end for YouTube video link input. The sheet will be available to the public to play with it. When a YouTube video link is pastet into the sheet, the video will automatically be downloaded and analysed with the Video Intelligence API. The output from the video analysis will go into a Google Data Studio dashboard also made available to the public with a visual video analysis.

Code will be up soon - just need to comment and strip it for secrets.
